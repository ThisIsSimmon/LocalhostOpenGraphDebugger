# Localhost Open Graph Debugger

Localhost Open Graph Debugger is a Chrome Extension designed to check the Open Graph meta tags of websites hosted locally.
By temporarily hosting the meta tags on our site, it simplifies the process, allowing you to easily verify them without the need for tunneling tools like ngrok.

## Usage

1. Add the extension to Chrome from [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/localhost-open-graph-debu/kckjjmiilgndeaohcljonedmledlnkij).
2. Display the local page you want to debug, then click on the extension icon.![Extension icon](src/assets/icon-16x16.png)
3. Press the Submit button at the bottom of the popup screen.
4. If successful, the debug page will open automatically. Copy that URL and test it with various debuggers.
