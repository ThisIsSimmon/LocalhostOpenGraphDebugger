# Localhost Open Graph Debugger

Localhost Open Graph Debugger is a Chrome Extension for checking Open Graph meta tags of locally hosted websites.
Since it temporarily hosts meta tags on our site, you can easily check them without using tunnels to localhost tool like ngrok.

## Usage

1. Add the extension to Chrome from [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/****/*****?hl=en).
2. Display the local site you want to check and click the extension icon.![Extension icon](dist/images/icon-16x16.png)
3. And then will open an online page hosting the meta tags and images of your local site, so you can copy the URL and check it with the sharing debugger.
