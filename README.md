# Localhost Open Graph Debugger

Localhost Open Graph Debugger is a Chrome Extension for checking Open Graph meta tags of locally hosted websites.
Since it temporarily hosts meta tags on our site, you can easily check them without using tunnels to localhost tool like ngrok.

## Usage

1. Add the extension to Chrome from [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/localhost-open-graph-debu/kckjjmiilgndeaohcljonedmledlnkij).
2. Display the local site you want to check and click the extension icon.![Extension icon](dist/images/icon-16x16.png)
3. If the process is successful, the "Open debug page" link will appear on popup.
4. Clicking on the "Open debug page" link will open an online page that hosts the meta tags and images of the local site so that you can copy the URL and review it in the shared debugger.
